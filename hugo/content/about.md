Our research group is dedicated to exploring the theoretical foundations and practical applications of blockchain technology. This includes in-depth studies of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as other emerging digital assets. We aim to unravel the core technologies that power these systems, including consensus mechanisms, cryptographic protocols, and smart contract platforms. Beyond the technical aspects, we also investigate the broader societal implications of blockchain adoption, such as its impact on finance, governance, privacy, and decentralization. Through our work, we strive to contribute to a deeper understanding of this transformative technology and its potential to reshape the future.
