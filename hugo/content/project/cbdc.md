Central banks worldwide are exploring the use of blockchain technology to issue and manage digital versions of fiat currencies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). However, this endeavor faces significant challenges. While most blockchain systems lack robust privacy protections, those that do offer privacy often do not support smart contracts, which are essential for enabling programmable money and advanced financial applications. Additionally, there is a need to balance privacy with regulatory requirements, such as allowing law enforcement to access transaction data under specific circumstances.

One promising theoretical solution to these challenges is the integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs could enable transaction privacy while still permitting selective disclosure for compliance purposes. However, the practical implementation of this approach remains a significant hurdle. The key challenge lies in developing a framework that seamlessly integrates privacy, smart contract functionality, and regulatory oversight into a CBDC system.
