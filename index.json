[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eIn the age of generative artificial intelligence, ensuring the provenance and authenticity of digital images has emerged as a critical challenge. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) introduced a signature scheme to address this issue, but it relies on trust when images are edited prior to publicationâ€”a near-ubiquitous scenario. Dan Boneh et al. proposed an alternative approach, replacing C2PA signatures with zero-knowledge proofs to verify that edits were applied to a legitimately signed image. While this represents a significant advancement, their method currently processes only one operation at a time, and proof generation remains computationally impractical for real-world use. This work focuses on optimizing the proving time of such verification methods while enabling the seamless composition of multiple editing operations within a single image.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":null,"permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/project/images/","title":""},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eVerifiable computation outsourcing has become a critical tool in various applications, particularly in scaling blockchain networks like Ethereum. A prominent example is the use of rollups, a layer-2 scaling solution designed to increase Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s transaction throughput. In this approach, transactions are offloaded to a secondary layer that mirrors Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s functionality but operates on a high-performance cluster. To maximize efficiency, hundreds of transactions are batched, compressed, and processed together. The resulting state of this layer-2 ledger is then computed and submitted to the Ethereum mainnet for verification and permanent record-keeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key component of this verification process is the use of Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs), which enable efficient and privacy-preserving proof generation. Currently, there are approximately a dozen team actively developing zkVM implementations. Given the growing interest and diversity in zkVM designs, our objective is to establish a comprehensive set of criteria for objectively evaluating and comparing their performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":null,"permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/project/benchmark/","title":""},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eCentral banks worldwide are exploring the use of blockchain technology to issue and manage digital versions of fiat currencies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). However, this endeavor faces significant challenges. While most blockchain systems lack robust privacy protections, those that do offer privacy often do not support smart contracts, which are essential for enabling programmable money and advanced financial applications. Additionally, there is a need to balance privacy with regulatory requirements, such as allowing law enforcement to access transaction data under specific circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne promising theoretical solution to these challenges is the integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs could enable transaction privacy while still permitting selective disclosure for compliance purposes. However, the practical implementation of this approach remains a significant hurdle. The key challenge lies in developing a framework that seamlessly integrates privacy, smart contract functionality, and regulatory oversight into a CBDC system.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":null,"permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/project/cbdc/","title":""},{"content":"","description":null,"image":"/images/team/christian.jpeg","permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/team/christian/","title":""},{"content":"","description":null,"image":"/images/team/gabriel.jpeg","permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/team/gabriel/","title":""},{"content":"","description":null,"image":"/images/team/heitor.jpeg","permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/team/heitor/","title":""},{"content":"","description":null,"image":"/images/team/jeroen.jpeg","permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/team/jeroen/","title":""},{"content":"","description":null,"image":"/images/team/lucas-f.jpeg","permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/team/lucas-f/","title":""},{"content":"","description":null,"image":"/images/team/lucas-p.jpeg","permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/team/lucas-p/","title":""},{"content":"","description":null,"image":"/images/team/luiz.jpeg","permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/team/luiz/","title":""},{"content":"","description":null,"image":"/images/team/semar.jpeg","permalink":"https://zkbr.github.io/team/semar/","title":""},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eOur research group is dedicated to exploring the theoretical foundations and practical applications of blockchain technology.
